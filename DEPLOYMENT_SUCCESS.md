All warnings are related to Next.js 15 deprecation of viewport in metadata exports. These are cosmetic and don't affect functionality:

```
⚠ Unsupported metadata viewport is configured in metadata export
Please move it to viewport export instead.
Read more: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-viewport
```

**Impact:** None - pages render correctly
**Action Required:** Can be addressed in future optimization pass
**Priority:** Low
